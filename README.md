# Web-Scraping

For my project i decided to scrape the listings for used sales on Cars.com to analyze factors that affect a cars resale value and depreciation rate. All listings scaped are of used car listings currently available from major cities across the US: New York City, Los Angeles, San Fransisco, Houston, Seattle, Miami, Chicago, and Boston.
